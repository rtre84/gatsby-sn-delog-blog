    "description": "Iâ€™m a software developer based out of Boston, MA. <br /><br /> The work I do, these days, revolves mostly around peta-byte scale distributed systems. Occasional freelancing and technical blogging have both given me a good reason to try and keep up with the various spaces discussed here.\n\nMy focus for the past 7 years has been on consulting and building software at brands like Directv, DSW, T-Mobile, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Wellington Management, Thesys CAT (a subsidiary of Thesys Tech formerly known as Tradeworx, Inc.) and Autodesk. Prior to that I used to do freelance web development and work at a small business called Eagle Stationery Est. based out of the United Arab Emirates. <br /><br /> Serving Niches focuses on Software Engineering, the more technical aspects of Online Marketing, Niche Marketing, Analytics, Fintech, Blockchain and occasionally AI and its various subsets."
